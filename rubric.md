# Rubric

## Functionality
Meets Expectations. However it's teetering because there exists not that much functionality. The application does upload files and has user authentication and those pieces are functional. I'm really proud that you got file uploading to work! Personally i've never done this because i'm scared too 0.0

## User Interface
Does not meet expectations. I'm not entirely sure but I'm presuming that you got hung up on trying to get file uploads to work and it slowed down/negated the ability to create your application. Due to its lack of being able to do the things you wanted for your application. The only user interface is to upload a picture. Once you load a picture, you have to still then go to the browser to get back to the home page.

## Code Quality/ Maintainability
Does not meet expectations. There's alot of code in here that doesn't serve a purpose.... yet. I'm positive that you have intentions for much of this code, but none of it's commented. This will make it much more difficult to get back to your code base to continue your process on this application. Which I strongly encourage. There's some issues with your views/layouts and doubling up on meta data.

## Evidence of Comprehension
Does not meet expectations. Again I think you weren't able to achieve the results you wanted because of the gigantic road block of file uploading. I would encourage you to try using image_urls instead just so you can get the MVP of your application, then apply the file uploading to that. Things that we expect at this point:
- we needed to see evidence of comprehension of javascript. Unfortunately do to scheduling you were unable to incorporate any JS
- we needed to see evidence of comprehension of server side functionality. The only backend that exists in your app is user authentication. There might be some backend functionality with photos, but i'm not entire sure if anythings being persisted
- the issue with your views indicates to me you're unsure of how templating and layouts work



### Review:
Because of the roadblock you were unable to show what you have learned in class and that makes it tough for me to evaluate your progress. I want to rehash the fact that I think you're more capable than this rubric states. This is just the results of the code review of your project in its current state. I would encourage you to keep working on this app and make sure it's ready for your meet and hire. Create a more substantial back end. Start small by figuring out your ERD's/Domain model. Integrate JS into your app, even if its something small like a drop down menu or a simple click event.
